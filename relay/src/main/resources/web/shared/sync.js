// WHAT THE SYNC CARD DECIDES, apart from how it draws it.
//
// The card's live half is marks over the router's progress document, and the
// judgements behind them — is the router alive, where is the constraint, which
// legs are worth naming and when is one stuck — lived inline in stats.html,
// where nothing could reach them.
//
// The cost was measured rather than assumed. The only pins over that code were
// string greps — `SyncProgressReportTest` reads stats.html as text and asserts
// that each published member NAME appears somewhere in it — and a grep cannot
// see a wrong denominator. An audit against crafted documents found five bugs
// that had all shipped: an empty health object drawing an empty chip, a
// percentage of an absent numerator rendering `NaN%`, a quiet bar scaled by a
// row that was not on screen, a division by a zero capacity, and two meters in
// one column whose full ends meant opposite things.
//
// So the decisions live here, as functions over plain data, and stats.html is
// left with DOM and the glossary. Numbers come out; the page formats them and
// hangs the document's own words on them. `tools/webtest/sync.test.mjs` is the
// half that can now be asserted.
//
// It is SMALL on purpose. The card's rebuild dropped the per-leg table, the
// outcome partition, the gauges and the per-relay coverage rows, and fourteen
// exports here went with them — they had survived only because their own tests
// still referenced them, which is how a module keeps answering questions
// nothing asks.

 * ## Checked, not unmeasured
 *
 * The document's number is `unmeasured`: what still has NO verdict. The card
 * draws its COMPLEMENT, because the two read in opposite directions and the
 * rising one is the one an operator wants — `7,546 of 11,693` climbing is a
 * fold falling behind, and it was the same fold getting steadily further along.
 * The subtraction is here, once, rather than in the page: it is exactly the
 * wrong-direction arithmetic this module exists to hold still.
 *
 * Clamped at zero, and that is not defensive noise. `SyncProgressReport`
 * defaults `unmeasured` to `candidates` when a row is unreadable — deliberately,
 * since "nothing left to measure" is a strong claim to make on a bad read — so
 * an old or truncated document lands on `checked = 0`, which is the honest end
 * of the range rather than a negative count.
 *
 * ## Summed across the streams, still
 *
 * `AliasMonitor.runPass` now merges every stream into one `all streams` work
 * item, so the array is a single row in practice. Summed anyway: reading
 * `streams[0]` made a fold that had never seen the two 17,000-url streams
 * report the 16-url one's residue as the whole picture, and that bug does not
 * come back just because today's router happens to publish one row.
 *
 * ## The clock, only when a pass is not running
 *
 * `lastPassSec` is the duration of the last pass that FINISHED. While the next
 * one is dialling, that number describes neither the pass on screen nor the one
 * being waited for, so it is withheld — a fold measuring for two hours must not
 * show the previous pass's `12m` beside it. Null before the first pass lands,
 * which is the whole of a cold boot.

 * The legs to draw, and how full each quiet bar is.

 * readings were tried and both lie. Scaled against the worst row PUBLISHED,
 * five bars rendered at 0.08% each when the outlier sat at row eight, outside
 * the five drawn: the comparison the bar exists to make, hidden. Scaled against
 * the worst row SHOWN, five legs each quiet a healthy thirty seconds rendered
 * full, which is the reading that means stuck. A proportion needs a denominator
 * that means something on its own, and the only one here is the threshold.
 *
 * ## The rows
 *
 * The router publishes them QUIETEST first (see `RelayRotation.held`), so the
 * first few are the legs worth looking at and `omitted` is the tail. This adds
 * whatever it drops to that count, because a truncated list that does not say
