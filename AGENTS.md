# Working on vespa-relay

A Nostr relay with trust-ranked NIP-50 search. Quartz's protocol engine
(`RelayServerBase`) over a [vespa-eventstore](https://github.com/NosFabrica/vespa-eventstore)
store, plus a router that mirrors events from upstream relays.

Three Gradle modules, JVM only (toolchain 21), two processes over one store:

- **`:relay`** — the serving side. `RelayMain` is its entrypoint.
- **`:sync`** — the router, as its own process so it restarts without the
  relay or Vespa noticing. `SyncMain` is its entrypoint; the package keeps the
  `router` name on purpose (see below).
- **`:common`** — only what both genuinely read: `RelayIdentity`,
  `SchemaDeploy`, `QuartzLogLevel`, `fmtDuration`, and `ServingPressure` —
  whose mean crosses the process boundary over the relay's `GET /pressure`,
  polled by the sync process to yield ingest when client reads slow down.
  Anything one process owns lives in that process's module.

## Commands

```bash
./gradlew build                    # compile + test + spotless check, all modules
./gradlew :relay:test              # serving-side tests
./gradlew :sync:test               # router tests (moved with the module)
./gradlew :sync:test --tests "*SyncBands*"
./gradlew spotlessApply            # fix formatting — do this before committing
./gradlew :relay:run               # the relay, locally (needs a Vespa at VESPA_URL)
./gradlew :sync:run                # the router, locally (adds SYNC_CONFIG_FILE)

node tools/webtest/run.mjs         # web UI module tests (plain node, no deps)

docker compose up -d --build relay # the usual dev loop (serving only)
docker compose --profile sync up -d --build   # …with the mirror
docker compose --profile onion up -d          # …with the relay's own .onion
docker compose --profile sync restart sync    # new router.conf, relay untouched
docker compose logs relay --since 5m
docker compose logs sync --since 5m

# A cloud sandbox has the docker binaries but NO daemon running. Start one
# before anything that needs it, and lower the API floor or testcontainers
# cannot talk to it (see the trap below):
DOCKER_MIN_API_VERSION=1.24 dockerd > /tmp/dockerd.log 2>&1 &
```

Bumping `vespaEventStore` is not done until the store's OWN integration gate has
run against the commit being pinned — the relay's tests use `InMemoryEventIndex`
and cannot see a Vespa-only regression:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NosFabrica/vespa-eventstore && cd vespa-eventstore
git checkout <the pinned commit>          # test what the relay actually resolves
TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true ./gradlew :benchmark:test -Pintegration --no-daemon
```

Six ITs, ~7 min total, each standing up a real Vespa. Fetching that repo works
here; pushing to it does not (the git proxy only holds a credential for repos in
the session's sources).

Git hooks are installed by the build: **pre-commit runs `spotlessCheck`,
pre-push runs the tests**. A commit will be rejected for formatting alone, so
run `spotlessApply` first.

## Layout

All three modules share the `com.nosfabrica.vespa.relay` package root — files
moved between modules in the process split without renaming packages, so
history and imports stayed put.

  index.html            the search UI's markup + styles; its behavior lives in web/
  web/                  the page's native ES modules, served at /web — no build
                        step, zero dependencies. app.js is state + wiring;
                        shared/ is the client + codec + caches; searchfield.js
                        is the search box itself — a contenteditable, because
                        `from:npub1…`/`to:npub1…` draw as a face and a name and
                        an <input>'s value is characters and nothing else, with
                        shared/query.js the ONE tokenizer the field asks — and
                        the REQ builder too: buildFilters() turns `#hashtag`
                        into the three ways Nostr writes a topic (`#t`, a
                        kind-1111 comment naming it in `i`/`I` per NIP-73, and a
                        `#l` label per NIP-32), ORed in one REQ, with the page
                        state passed IN so the whole thing is testable —
                        tools/webtest/query.test.mjs asserts the filters, and
                        RelayProtocolTest asserts the relay answers them;
                        shared/parents.js answers "in reply to WHO" — NIP-10's
                        rule for which `e` tag is the parent, plus the by-id
                        lookup for the author when the tag carries no hint;
                        entity.js
                        renders /npub1…//note1…//naddr1… paths; feed.js is the
                        latest feed — three cards under the hero for a signed-in
                        reader, a hundred at /?feed=1 — and is an EMPTY SEARCH:
                        buildFilters() with no words and none of the bar's
                        NIP-50 extensions leaves `{kinds, limit}`, a plain
                        NIP-01 read, which is the only shape the store answers
                        newest-first (a stray `sort:` would rank it while the
                        page said "latest"), so the feed hides the Filters
                        disclosure — but NOT the kind chips, which are the
                        `kinds` of that same read and narrow the feed under the
                        hero and at /?feed=1&tab=media alike, replacing the
                        content default rather than intersecting it (four of
                        the seven narrowing chips share no kind with it); what
                        is
                        feed.js's own is the shaping — replies, future dates and
                        duplicates never reach a card; cards/ is the
                        kind registry — one renderer module per family, a
                        generic floor for the rest, and a render test that
                        FAILS if a kind registers without a fixture, a badge
                        label or a family tone. The NIP-51 lists and sets are
                        one table in cards/lists.js rather than one renderer
                        each: they differ only in which tags carry their items.
                        index.html's header records the rules and why "one
                        file" ended.
  kind_stats.html       operator diagnostics, each carrying its own tiny relay
  observer_stats.html   client on purpose: they must work when the app does
                        not. kind_stats reads shared/kinds.js for the kinds to
                        count — that list IS "which kinds do we support", and a
                        second copy would go stale in the direction that hides
                        events. The CLIENT is what stays self-contained; a
                        table of integers is not worth duplicating
```

`docs/configuration.md` documents every environment variable and
`docs/router.md` the router config format. They are the reference; this file is
the orientation.

## The router, in one pass

`SyncEngine` syncs upstream events into the store. Operators know this
subsystem as **the router** — `router.conf`, the `router:` log prefix and the
`router` package keep that name. Its env vars are `SYNC_*`; the pre-rename
`ROUTER_*` spellings still work and warn on boot.

It is its own process (`SyncMain`, the compose `sync` service behind
`--profile sync`), so a `router.conf` change is a `restart sync`, never a
relay outage — and the sync bands make the re-run resume rather than
re-download. The relay hard-errors if `SYNC_CONFIG*` is aimed at it: that
setting used to start the mirror in-process, and accepting-but-ignoring it
would be a mirror that quietly stopped mirroring. Two kinds of stream:

- **static** — relays listed in `urls` in `router.conf`
- **dynamic** — relays discovered from stored events via `relaySource` (NIP-65
  outbox lists, NIP-85 provider lists, relay hints)

Each stream declares **how** it asks for what it is missing, via `sync`:

| mode | when | why |
|---|---|---|
| `negentropy` | the same event lives on many relays (kinds 0/3/10002) | reconcile id sets, transfer only the difference |
| `fetch` | the two sides barely overlap, or the store is empty and there is nothing to compare against | comparing disjoint sets costs more than downloading, and builds a huge local id snapshot to do it |
| `auto` | unknown | reconcile once WE hold more than `SYNC_NEG_MIN_EVENTS` for the filter, else page. Only our own count — asking the relay too meant a NIP-45 COUNT per relay per cycle, and COUNT is optional, widely unimplemented, and slow where it exists |

**It is a property of the data AND of how the stream asks — not of the relay,
and not measurable from counts.** NIP-85 assertions were the standing example of
`fetch` here: per-provider, millions each, no overlap. Asked per (relay,
provider) instead of by kind, the same data overlaps almost entirely and
`negentropy` is right. Narrowing the ask inverted the answer, so re-derive it
when a stream's filter changes shape rather than trusting the label.

**`.onion` upstreams go through Tor, chosen per url** (`TorTransport`,
`SYNC_TOR_SOCKS`). quartz's socket builder takes
`(NormalizedRelayUrl) -> OkHttpClient`, so hidden services get the proxied
client and clearnet keeps the direct one — routing a 20k-relay cycle through
Tor to reach the handful on it would trade the fan-out for the exception. The
mechanism is OkHttp's: given a SOCKS proxy it hands the hostname over instead
of calling `Dns.lookup`, so the name resolves inside Tor. Never give that
client a `Dns` — it would move resolution back out here, breaking `.onion` and
leaking every hidden service we sync with to the local resolver. Two rules
follow from the same place: the TCP pre-probe is skipped for onion urls (it is
a DNS lookup, and it would publish `UnknownHostException` as proof of a dead
relay), and nothing negative is ever published about one — reaching a hidden
service depends on our circuit as much as on their server.

**Sync bands** record the `created_at` span already walked for a
`(relay, filter)` pair, so a re-run asks only outside it. Keyed by the *whole
filter* deliberately: edit a stream's filter and its band is invalidated, which
is the intended way to force a re-walk. A paged fetch records `complete = false`;
only a finished negentropy reconcile records `complete = true`.

**The arithmetic is quartz's** — `SyncCoverage`, in
`nip01Core.relay.client.accessories`, beside `fetchAllPages` and
`negentropySyncOrFetch`. `SyncBands` here is only the file: `SYNC_STATE_FILE`,
the flush thread, the env names. It used to own a copy of the whole algorithm,
and that fork silently missed two upstream fixes — a relay needing NOTHING was
widening the shared snapshot to the full filter, and a `complete` band was not
re-opening its older leg when the caller's floor dropped below it. **Fix band
behaviour upstream, not here**, or the next quartz bump reverts it. The
on-disk shape (`{key: {min, max, complete, fullAt}}`) is this repo's and is
pinned by a test.

**Windowed reconciliation** (`NegentropyPager`) is the layer *above* a single
reconcile call, and the division of labour with quartz is the thing to
understand before touching it. It moved once already: quartz used to take a
materialised id list and know nothing about our side, so this class did the
pre-split, sniffed the peer's cap off the wire, and re-tried windows around a
dense second. All three now live upstream (`NegentropyLocalIndex`,
`targetWindow`, `NegentropySyncResult.peerCap`, `onUnreconcilableWindow` — see
amethyst#3871), and this class shrank to what survives a call:

- **the cursor** (`SweepState`), written per finished window, because quartz
  forgets everything between calls and a band is only recorded per leg;
- **the per-peer window size**, learned from `peerCap` across syncs and
  persisted, so a restart does not re-walk the ladder;
- **the order windows are walked in** — strictly newest-first, which is what
  keeps the finished region contiguous, which is the only reason the cursor can
  be one timestamp instead of a set of intervals. Every push preserves it; check
  that before adding one.

Everything inside a call is quartz's: splitting a window it cannot reconcile,
bounding what it reads from the index (`PrimedIndex` hands it the count this
layer already took, so the same window is not counted twice), and draining a
second no window size will fit through the hook this class passes it. Engaged
automatically by `StaticBackfill` once our own count passes
`SYNC_NEG_PAGE_TARGET`; the dynamic fan-out deliberately still shares one
snapshot across its 16k relays, where per-peer windowing would multiply the
store work by the fan-out.

**Known open bug (now upstream's):** a band holds one span for every kind in
the filter, so a long-lived kind (0) vouches for a short-lived one (30382) and
`legs()` skips the interior. The fix is per-kind spans *inside* the
filter-keyed band — not per-kind keys, which would break the invalidation
property above. Still unfixed; it stopped biting only because `assertions`
narrowed to a single kind, so any multi-kind filter can walk into it again.

## Instrumentation — use it before theorising

Most of this exists because something was diagnosed wrongly from inference.
Reach for it first.

- **health line** (once a minute) — heap, ingest queue depth vs capacity, ev/s,
  relays transferring, connected, fatal count, events lost to store errors. A
  full queue and an empty queue are opposite diagnoses that look identical
  everywhere else.
- **`SYNC_WIRE_LOG`** — `sent` logs every REQ/CLOSE; `full` adds every message
  received. Empty still logs `NOTICE`, `CLOSED` and failed sends, which are the
  relay explaining itself. It lowers quartz's log floor itself, because
  `QUARTZ_LOG_LEVEL=WARN` would otherwise silently discard its own output.
- **`SYNC_STREAMS`** — run one stream alone, so a measurement isn't three
  streams competing for one socket budget, heap and ingest queue.
- **`ingest stages`** — per-stage timing (`dedup`, `write`, `proj.fetch`,
  `proj.write`, `versions`). This is what identified a projection read-back as
  90% of ingest.
- **paging progress** — percentage and ETA measured on the *time axis*, because
  a paged fetch has no event denominator. Its predecessor computed
  `downloaded/downloaded` and printed `100%, ETA ~0:00` for hours.

## Conventions

**Comments say why, with evidence.** The codebase's KDoc records what actually
happened — measured numbers, the wrong turn that motivated the current shape.
Match that register. `// increment the counter` is noise; "this was
`inboundCapacity = batch * 4` with no ceiling, so batch 20000 sized the queue at
80,000 events and the heap went over" is the house style.

**Tests assert the property, not the implementation.** `NIP-50 extensions
survive the session to the engine query` passed unchanged through a wholesale
replacement of the mechanism it covers. Conversely, a test that asserted
`everReconciled`'s exact behaviour passed while shipping a bug, because it
encoded the implementation's own opinion of itself.

**A configured component must never be silently inert.** Several bugs here were
a switch that was read, accepted, and did nothing. If a flag needs something else
to be true, make it true and say so.

**Don't publish claims you can't support.** Negative NIP-66 records are signed
and public. `Unreachability.proves()` is deliberately conservative: an unknown
failure stays quiet, because silence costs a retry and being wrong costs a false
statement about someone else's server.

## Traps that have cost real time

- **JitPack pins are commit hashes, and Gradle resolves conflicts
  lexicographically.** Pinning quartz to `6d518adddb` while the store carried
  `79f198c729` silently resolved to the latter — `'7' > '6'`. Hence
  `resolutionStrategy { force(libs.quartz) }` in EVERY module's build file —
  each of `:common`, `:relay` and `:sync` resolves quartz independently, and a
  new module must add its own force. Never remove one, and check that a pin
  actually took effect.
- **JitPack's build-status API lies.** It reported a build `ok` whose log ended
  in `exit code 1`. Only the presence of the artifact file proves anything.
- **An integration run that skips still prints `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`.** Three
  things stack up to make "I ran the ITs" a false claim, and none of them
  announces itself:
  - A cloud sandbox ships `docker`/`dockerd` but runs no daemon. `docker info`
    fails with "is the daemon running?" — start `dockerd` yourself.
  - Docker 29 refuses API versions below 1.40; testcontainers 1.20.4 (what the
    store's ITs use) speaks 1.32 and gets `400 client version 1.32 is too old`.
    Every IT then hits its own `assumeTrue(dockerAvailable())` and aborts.
    Start the daemon as `DOCKER_MIN_API_VERSION=1.24 dockerd`.
  - The Gradle daemon inherits the environment it STARTED with, so env vars set
    on the `./gradlew` command line never reach the forked test JVM if a daemon
    from before is reused. Use `--no-daemon` when the env is the point.

  A skip is invisible in console output. Read `skipped="…"` in
  `build/test-results/test/*.xml`, or `--rerun-tasks` and check the wall time:
  six real Vespa ITs take ~7 minutes, not 7 seconds. Testcontainers logs the
  actual reason through SLF4J, and with no binding on the test classpath that
  goes to a NOP logger — put `logback-classic` on a probe classpath and call
  `DockerClientFactory.instance().isDockerAvailable()` directly to see it.
- **JitPack caches builds per group-spelling.** `com.github.NosFabrica` and
  `com.github.nosfabrica` are separate cache entries for the same repo; one
  can permanently hold a failed infra build while the other serves fine. The
  store coordinate uses lowercase for this reason — check the other spelling
  before concluding a commit "doesn't build".
- **Two KDoc blocks in a row** fail ktlint (`standard:kdoc`, "dangling toplevel
  KDoc"). Each doc needs its own declaration.
- **`grep` may be aliased to `ugrep`**, which silently returns nothing on some
  large files. Use `/usr/bin/grep` when a search "finds nothing" implausibly.
- **`\n` inside a Kotlin raw string is literal**, which breaks HOCON fixtures in
  tests. Use real line breaks.
- **A timeout is an idle window, not a deadline.** quartz's accessory APIs
  reset their clock on every message (`1622bd7109`); code here must match. A
  deadline measured from send counts time spent QUEUED behind other work, so a
  relay steadily answering looks like one that refused. Measured on one relay,
  146 asks: a 15s deadline scored 55 answered and 91 "timed out" with a median
  answer of 75ms — and **zero** of those 91 were ever refused. Size an idle
  window by the slowest SINGLE answer, not by the queue.
- **Verify under load, not while idle.** A schema fix was "confirmed" by counting
  zero rejections during a window with no writes flowing. It was the wrong fix.
- **When editing quartz/amethyst alongside this repo**, that project *is*
  multiplatform: commas in backticked test names break Kotlin/Native, and
  `java.util` APIs (`toSortedMap`) break every non-JVM target. Compile more than
  the JVM target.

## Operations

`docker-compose.yml` runs Vespa, the relay, (behind `--profile sync`) the sync
process and a client-only Tor, and (behind `--profile onion`) a second Tor that
is the relay's own hidden service — one store throughout. Vespa holds
~50M events in this deployment. The JVM memory budget is per process: the sync
container carries the large limit because the negentropy id snapshots live
there; check the machine's total against those three limits when the profile is
on (Tor's rounds to nothing).

**Tor is a container, not a layer.** One image carries both JVM processes on
purpose, so installing a daemon in it would put Tor in the serving relay too,
give the container a second thing to supervise, and make `restart sync` — a
`router.conf` edit, meant to be cheap — drop every circuit and re-bootstrap.
Its SOCKS port is published nowhere: an open SOCKS proxy on a public interface
is an open proxy.

**Two Tors, because they are two jobs.** `tor` (profile `sync`) is the client
proxy the router dials `.onion` *upstreams* through. `tor-onion` (profile
`onion`) is the relay's own front door: one hidden service forwarding to the
relay's port, so any Tor client can reach it without the clearnet name, a
certificate or a public IP. Same image, different torrc, and wanted
independently — a serving-only box wants a front door and no mirror. Three
things about it are not obvious and each cost a config that would not start:

- **tor refuses a hostname in `HiddenServicePort`** ("Unparseable address in
  hidden service port configuration"), so the entrypoint resolves the compose
  service name itself and appends the line to a generated torrc. Docker hands a
  re-created container a new IP and nothing in Tor re-resolves it, so the same
  script watches the name and restarts the container when it moves — the key is
  on a volume, so the address survives and only the descriptor blinks.
- **the key IS the address.** `tor_onion` holds it, mounted into that container
  and nowhere else; the relay gets a second volume carrying the hostname alone,
  read-only. `docker compose down -v` is what changes the address.
- **the torrc is generated, so tuning is a mounted file** —
  `tor/onion.extra.conf.example`, appended last. Single-hop mode (half the
  latency, and a one-way door on that key), PoW defenses, introduction points:
  each is a decision, so each is off and documented rather than chosen here.
- **the relay has to know its own `.onion`**, because NIP-42 auth events are
  signed against the address the client dialled. Without it reads and publishes
  still work and every AUTH fails, which costs Tor clients their ranking lens
  and looks like nothing at all — the reason the address is handed over in a
  file rather than an env var someone pastes in later.
- **the clearnet endpoint advertises it** with `Onion-Location` on EVERY
  response, the websocket 101 included — a Nostr client may make no other
  request, so a header on `GET /` alone would never reach the clients this is
  for. Tor Browser shows the ".onion available" button; Amethyst caches the
  mapping and rewrites the host when Tor is on. It rewrites the TRANSPORT, not
  the relay's identity, so such a client signs its AUTH with the clearnet url
  on a connection that arrived through the onion: accepting any address we
  answer at, rather than binding the policy to the address dialled, is what
  makes that work.

**Clients-first crosses the process boundary by HTTP.** The relay measures
client read latency into `ServingPressure` and serves the mean on
`GET /pressure`; the sync process polls it (`SYNC_PRESSURE_URL`) and yields
ingest between batches past the threshold. Three failed polls reset the
throttle — a relay that is down has no clients to protect — and both the feed
being off and the feed being lost are said out loud in the sync log.

**The trust reconcile runs in the background.** It used to be
`runBlocking { reconcileTrustWithRetry(store) }` between opening the store and
starting the listener — no websocket, no router and no NIP-11 until it finished,
measured at 12+ minutes on this corpus with Vespa at 356% CPU. It now runs
behind the server: the relay serves immediately and ranked search returns less
until the reconcile lands. `TRUST_RECONCILE_ON_START=false` skips it entirely.

If a start still looks slow, check that before blaming Vespa's transaction-log
replay — that wrong attribution is already in this file's history.

Both processes **deploy the bundled Vespa schema on every boot** (`AUTO_DEPLOY`,
default true), so the cluster always matches the code talking to it. A no-change
deploy is a cheap no-op. This is not decoration: when the schema drifted, Vespa
answered every write with `Status 400 ... Field 'name_parts' is not defined` and
the router counted, dropped and carried on — 2,336,288 good events lost in one
run, unrecoverable, while every status line read healthy.

Structural rejections are surfaced separately from ordinary ones on the health
line (`N event(s) LOST to store errors`), because a bad signature is the event's
fault and dropping it is correct, whereas a batch failing structurally is ours.

**Two levers delete data.** Both default to a dry run that reports and removes
nothing; run that first, and read the number before believing it.

- `SWEEP_ORPHAN_SCORES_ON_START` — kind-30382 cards from providers no stored
  10040 names. On this deployment that was 33.8M of 51.9M, and the dry run
  predicted the figure exactly.
- `deleteMissing` on a stream — records the upstream no longer serves. The
  licence is a COMPLETED reconcile, never a volume: quartz throws rather than
  falling back, so a normal return means every window was compared and an empty
  answer is the relay's answer rather than its silence. There is deliberately no
  size guard, because a mass retraction is exactly the case that matters. It is
  scoped by `ownedKinds` (required): the rest of the filter is mirrored from the
  same relay and dropped only when a service's whole owned set is retracted —
  measured, no NIP-85 provider relay serves its own key's kind 0, so judging
  those by absence would delete every healthy provider's profile.

The counterpart to both: a deletion is not a tombstone. A stream that still asks
by kind re-downloads whatever was freed on its next walk, so reclaiming space and
narrowing the ask are one job.
